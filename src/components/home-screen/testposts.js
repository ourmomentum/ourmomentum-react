Cable companies now own lots of TV stations. Google and Facebook now control a lot of the internet. And the advertising business has its own new role â€” as the gold mine for new customers for just about everyone. \n No worries about \"real journalism\" \nLast night on PBS NewsHour, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman responded to the barrage of criticism he's received from Clinton and Sanders supporters this week for calling Clinton \"candidate Clinton,\" and declaring his intention to support her. Krugman attacked Sanders, arguing that Sanders doesn't have the credibility to support Hillary Clinton, and dismissing the Vermont senator"

The last thing we're going to do is writing a custom constructor, it'll be a little bit trickier, but if you're interested, I've written a basic one here. \nYour constructor will be called with two arguments. A const variable. It can contain any type of value. Let's say, one of those arguments is a reference to some type. There's two ways you can deal with that.
